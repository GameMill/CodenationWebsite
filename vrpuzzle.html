 You are a leading researcher for a company called Researchacity and have been with the company for 5 years. <br>
You wake up in your apartment because the phone starts to ring. <br>
 It the manager and he tell you that a new planet has been discovered, <br>
 a super-earth named "Kepler-452b" and they what you to travel there and see begin researching the planet. <br>
 you are told that with the new hyper engine we can travel there in just 3 months. <br>
 </p>
 <p>
 When you arrive on Kepler-452b. <br>
 you are taken to an island where Researchacity has set up a military compound and have an office set up in mountains. <br>
 You will go see the director who tells you. <br>
 You will be the first person to be visiting the mainland. <br>
 That is just 50 miles offshore from the small island Researchacity has selected for its base of operation and that you will be there for a few months. <br> 
 you have been given some supplies A Tempery Base, a few turrets, and a lot of cemetery equipment. <br>
 you will also have 4 guards to help keep you safe. <br>
 You board a helicopter to take you to the mainland can take off for the mainland but before you arrive at the safe spot selected, you are hit by a sudden thunderstorm. <br>
 
</p><p>
You are thrown out of the chopper by one of the guards with a parachute when you land you can no longer see the chopper. <br>
All you have is the scanner you had in your pocket. <br>
you will need to use the scanner to find some way to contact Researchacity and report the problem. <br>
But on your first night, you notice that the wild animals are suddenly becoming aggressive and will attack on sight. <br>
 Build a shelter, Craft some weapons, Do your research and you might find a way to survive. But watch out there more out there than a few wild animals.
