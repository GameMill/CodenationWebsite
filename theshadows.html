          When you arrive on Kepler-452b. <br><br>
          you are taken to an island where Researchacity has set up a military compound and have an office set up in mountains. <br>
          You will go see the director who tells you. <br>
          You will be the first person to be visiting the mainland. <br>
          That is just 50 miles offshore from the small island Researchacity has selected for its base of operation and that you will be there for a few months. <br>
